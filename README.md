# Java_Netbeans_ControlParkingProject_with_MyPhpAdmin_through_XAMPP_ArroyoJuan_118830025
This project uses databases through XAMPP (PhpMyAdmin). The idea of this project is to have a control parking where the user can verify if the place is already taken or it's available to set a new client. This project was based on a basic project on programming 2 on Castro Carazo University...

Here's some instructions if there's a problem with the export of the database.
Here's how the database was created:
database name: proyecto_g4_prograii
name and values of the tables: 
table_parking
	id int 10 primary key
	name varchar 50
	last name varchar 50
	email varchar 50
	positionParking varchar 50
table_parkingrs
	id int 10 primary key
	name varchar 50
	lastname varchar 50
	email varchar 50
	positionParkingrs varchar 50

Also, some versions that were used:
apache-tomcat-9.0.78
